Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
ANS: Software engineering is the application of engineering principles on design, development, testing and maintenance of software systems. It ensures that applications are reliable and of high quality, especially in industries that software malfunctions can have dire consequences. 
It also streamlines processes to enable teams to work efficiently. Software engineering also enhances security of systems against cyberattacks

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
ANS: Structured programming, Scrum and Kaban

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
ANS: Planning- Here, you define the project, timeline, and required resources
     Analysis- Gathering detailed requirements of the user needs
     Design- Creating the architecture and structure of the system
     Implementation- Writing of the actual code
     Testing- Testing the software for bugs and performance issues
     Deployment - Software is released to users
     Maintenance - ongoing maintenance is required to fix bugs, updates, and user feedback

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
ANS: The waterfall methodology is linear and sequential making it rigid while the Agile methodology is iterative and incremental making it flexible. When using the waterfall methodology, changes are difficult once one phase is complete while with agile methodology, changes can be done at any stage. In waterfall methodology, extensive documentation is required while in Agile methodology, minimal documentation is required with more focus on development. Waterfall Methodology is used in projects with well-defined requirements, short-term projects, and projects with strict compliance e.g. in aviation systems. Agile methodology is used in projects with many changing requirements, projects requiring a lot of consumer feedback, and innovative projects e.g mobile apps like Facebook

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
ANS: Software Developer- Writes clean, efficient code, debugs and fixes software issues, tests code to ensure functionality and performance, collaborates with team members to create system architecture, translates software requirements into working applications.
Quality assurance engineer- Designing test plans, cases and strategies, conducts manual and automated tests of software applications, reports and documents bugs found in testing, collaborates with developers to solve the issues, ensures softwares meet both functional and non-funtional requirements.
Project manager- Defines scope, goals and deliverables of projects, creates timelines and allocates resources, ensures timely issue resolution, facilitates communication of team and stakeholders, tracks project progress, ensures projects meet quality standards

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
ANS: IDEs- Important in code efficiency and productivity, debugging and detecting errors, integrated compilation and execution, project management. E.g. IntelliJ IDEA, pycharm
VCS- Important in collaboration and teamwork, history tracking, backup and security. E.g. Git, Mercurial

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
ANS: Maintaining and managing complex codebases, debugging and fixing bugs, keeping up with changing technologies, meeting project deadlines, security vulnerabilities
Solutions- Follow clean coding practices and document code, use debugging tools and implement unit testing to catch bugs early, follow tech blogs, webinars and participate in coding communities, use Agile methodologies, follow secure coding practices and use encryption where needed.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
ANS: Unit testing- This is testing individual components of a software application in isolation. This helps to catch bugs early and improve code quality.
     Integration testing- This is testing the interaction between different components of a software application to ensure they work together correctly. This helps to identify interface defects, ensures different components function cohesively and reduces major failures when modules are combined.
     System testing- This tests the entire software application as a whole to verify it meets set requirements. This helps to ensure that all integrated components work correctly and validates that the system behaves as expected in different conditions. It also detects system wide issues before deplpoyment. 
     Acceptance testing- This is the final test and is done by end users to determine if it meets their needs. This helps to ensure that the software meets real world business needs and user expectations and provides approval before deployment

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
ANS: Prompt engineering is the practise of crafting inputs to guide AI models to generate accurate relevant and high-quality responses to meet user needs. When done well, it leads to precise answers , improves efficiency of the AI, ensures answers align with the context provided, reduces misinterpretations

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
ANS: Instead of saying, 'Help me make this text better', one could say, 'Help me make this text better by writing it in a professional tone, keeping it concise and highlighting main points in bullet points.'
